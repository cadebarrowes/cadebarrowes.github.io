        <h2><strong>Practice good nonverbal communication</strong></h2>

        <article>
            <p>It's about demonstrating confidence: standing straight, making eye contact and connecting with <a
                    href="//www.monster.com/career-advice/article/perfect-your-business-handshake">a firm handshake</a>.
                That
                first <a href="//www.monster.com/career-advice/article/nonverbal-communications-interview">nonverbal</a>
                impression can be a great beginning—or quick ending—to your interview.</p>

        <h2><strong>Dress for the job or company</strong></h2>

        <article>
            <p>Today's <a href="https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/Appropriate-Interview-Dress">casual dress
                    codes</a> do not give you permission to dress as "they" do when you interview. It is important to
                know
                <a href="//www.monster.com/career-advice/article/what-to-wear-for-job-interviews">what to wear to an
                    interview</a> and to be well-groomed. Whether you wear a suit or something less formal depends on

                    culture</a> and the position you are seeking. If possible, call to find out about the <a

                before the interview.</p>

        <h2><strong>Listen</strong></h2>

        <article>
            <p>From the very beginning of the interview, your interviewer is giving you information, either directly or
                indirectly. If you are not hearing it, you are missing a major opportunity. <a
                    href="https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/communicate-better-at-work-0117">Good
                    communication
                    skills</a> include listening and letting the person know you heard what was said. Observe your
                interviewer,
                and match that style and pace.</p>
        </article>

        <h2><strong>Don't talk too much </strong></h2>

        <article>
            <p>Telling the interviewer more than he needs to know could be a fatal mistake. When you have not prepared
                ahead
                of
                time, you may ramble&nbsp;when answering <a

                    questions</a>, sometimes talking yourself right out of the job. <a

                    for the interview</a> by reading through the <a
                    href="https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/job-description-0617">job posting</a>, matching
                your
                skills with the position's requirements and relating only that information.</p>
        </article>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2><strong>Don't be too familiar </strong></h2>

        <article>
            <p>The interview is a professional meeting to talk business. This is not about making a new friend. Your
                level
                of
                familiarity should mimic the interviewer's demeanor. It is important to bring energy and enthusiasm to
                the
                interview and to ask questions, but do not overstep your place as a candidate looking for a job.</p>
        </article>

        <h2><strong>Use appropriate language</strong></h2>

        <article>
            <p>It's a given that you should use <a
                    href="https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/persuade-new-job-crimmins-1216">professional
                    language</a> during the interview. Be aware of any inappropriate slang words or references to age,
                race,
                religion, politics, or sexual orientation—these topics could send you out the door very quickly.</p>
        </article>

        <h2><strong>Don't be cocky</strong></h2>

        <article>
            <p>Attitude plays a key role in your interview success. There is a fine balance between <a
                    href="https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/build-confidence-at-work-0217">confidence</a>,
                professionalism, and modesty. Even if you're putting on a performance to demonstrate your ability,
                overconfidence is as bad, if not worse, as being too reserved.</p>
        </article>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2><strong>Take care to answer the questions</strong></h2>

        <article>
            <p>When interviewers ask for an example of a time when you did something, they are asking <a
                    href="//www.monster.com/career-advice/article/you-can-survive-the-behavioral-interview"
                    target="">behavioral
                    interview questions</a>, which are designed to elicit a sample of your past behavior. If you fail to
                relate
                a specific example, you not only don't answer the question, but you also miss an opportunity to prove
                your
                ability and talk about your skills.</p>
        </article>

        <h2><strong>Ask questions</strong></h2>

        <article>
            <p>When asked if they have any questions, most candidates answer, "No." Wrong answer. Part of knowing how to
                interview is being ready to <a
                    href="https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/nine-questions-to-ask-interview">ask
                    questions</a>
                that
                demonstrate an interest in what goes on in the company. Asking questions also gives you the opportunity
                to
                find
                out if this is the right place for you. The best questions come from listening to what you're asked
                during
                the
                interview and asking for additional information.</p>

    <section>
        <h2><strong>Don't appear desperate</strong></h2>

        <article>
            <p>When you interview with the "please, please hire me" approach, you appear desperate and less confident.
                Reflect
                the three Cs during the interview: cool, calm, and confident.</p>
        </article>

        <h2><strong>Bonus tip: Work on your answers</strong></h2>

        <article>
            <p>You know you can do the job; make sure the interviewer believes you can, too. One way to do this is by
                preparing
                well-thought-out answers to questions they're most likely to ask. Need some help with
                that?<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://member.monster.com/">Join Monster for free today.</a>&nbsp;As a
