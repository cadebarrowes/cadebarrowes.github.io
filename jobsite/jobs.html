            <p>The way we go about getting jobs has changed. Through technology and the networks that offer more intel
                on our
                prospective employers, we are better prepared than ever to find the right career path.</p>
            <p>The latest generation of job-seekers is also different, and not only in how it approaches the task of
                finding
                work, but in its philosophy and attitude.</p>
            <p>To get a better sense of the state of job hunting – and how it will likely evolve – FORBES spoke with
                Janice
                Clements-Skelton, chief human resources officer with EBI Consulting and a member of the <a
                    href="https://www.shrm.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"
                    data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.shrm.org/">Society for Human Resource Management</a>’s
                Special
                Expertise Panel.</p>
            <p>Finding the right occupation is important, she argues, not just for scoring a paycheck in an expensive
                world, but
                for career happiness. “You, at 22, are going to work, in all likelihood, for 50 years,” warns
                Clements-Skelton.
                “Make sure you love it.”</p>

            <p><strong>The New Job Hunters</strong></p>
            <p>“There is a fearlessness about this generation,” says Clements-Skelton. “They are risk-takers, they are
                willing
                the try something new, they are willing to punch above their weight.”</p>
            <p>Younger people looking for work today also have a different outlook on failure, she said, in that they
                are more
                willing to learn from failure and do not see it as a source of shame that would forever stain their
                resumes. “I
                see a generation that has come into the workforce and has been made bolder through the use of technology
                and
                information.”</p>
            <p>Because job seekers have more access to intel – through LinkedIn, Glassdoor and other such sites – they
                simply
                know more about companies they are contemplating working for and have the power to contact employees of
                those
                firms. “Because of that,” says Clements-Skelton, “The interview process has become more collaborative
                and much
                more transparent.”</p>

            <p><strong>Is It Time To Find Something New?</strong></p>
            <p>One important element in a job search process is knowing, first of all, when it’s the right time to look
                for a
                new job. To Clements-Skelton, that means asking yourself several questions: Do you feel like you are
                growing in
                your role? Do you have the type of relationship with your manager that you want to have? And, do you see
                a
                career path laid out before you? “If you have an honest conversation in those three areas, It’s pretty
                easy to
                figure out whether you’ve hit a rough patch that you can work through, or if it is time to move on.”</p>

            <p>If you identify discontent in one or more of these areas, be aware that you might be able to rectify your
                situation by speaking with your manager or HR rep. If you do so and still feel unhappy, then you need to
                start
                the search process.</p>
            <p>To that end, Clements-Skelton provides some guidance in the tips below.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
        <p><strong>Narrowing Your Search</strong></p>
        <p>• As it always has been, networking is key. The difference now, of course, is that there are tools to do it.
            An
            internal referral or even a LinkedIn introduction can set you apart from the pack.</p>
        <p>• Social Media is important for job candidates. If you are not in a confidential search, posting to your
            social
            networks that you are looking, and what you are looking for, is an important form of networking.</p>
        <p>• Organizations still post to job sites. While LinkedIn, Monster and Career Builders are still relevant,
            Indeed.com scrapes corporate web sites, so look there too. Don’t ignore, ZipRecruiter, Simply Hired and
            Mighty
            Recruiter.</p>
        <p>• Cold Calling is an option. If you have identified one or more organizations, that you believe offer the
            ideal
            work and environment, but they do not have a position posted, you can cold call.&nbsp; Using publically
            available information, or your network for an introduction, you can send your resume and a cover letter
            requesting a call or visit to learn more about the company and to introduce yourself for future
            consideration.&nbsp; Many businesses will make “opportunity hires” when they meet a great person and know
            they
            will have a need, but don’t have an open position quite yet</p>

            <p><strong>Sending Your Application</strong></p>
            <p>• Your resume must be flawless: spelling, grammar and accuracy still matter and can be the difference
                between
                being screened for the position and being screened out of consideration.</p>
            <p>• The Cover Letter is not dead, but it looks different than it used to. A brief, meaningful, unique cover
                letter
                will get attention.&nbsp; Recruiters want to know that you actually read the job posting and believe
                that you
                are a fit, not that you are applying based on a key word search.</p>

            <p><strong>Vetting A Job Offer</strong></p>

            <p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/960x0/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fimageserve%2F594135062%2F960x0.jpg%3Ffit%3Dscale"
                alt="Shutterstock" width="90%" style="display: block;"></p>
            <p>When you do receive a job offer, it’s important to understand the compensation and benefits packages that
                employers offer, such as…</p>
            <p>1. Base salary or hourly rate and the possibility for overtime pay</p>
            <p>2. Any bonus structure or signing bonus</p>
            <p>3. Tuition reimbursement and professional development costs</p>
            <p>4. 401K match</p>
            <p>5. Relocation assistance</p>
            <p>6. Housing, transportation, meals</p>
            <p>• On-line salary data can be useful in determining if you have received a “market rate” offer. Sites
                like,
                Glassdoor, Salry.com and PayScales can help in your research, but because they rely on candidates
                reporting
                their salary, do tend to run about 10% higher than reality.</p>
            <p>• Making a connection with the people you will be working for and with, will affect how much you like,
                and how
                well you do in your job. In the best fits, candidates report an ease in communicating and a sense of
                shared
                vision.&nbsp; If your conversations with folks at the hiring company were awkward, or understanding was
                difficult, this may not be the right role for you.</p>
            <p>• Going back to your original list from preparing for a search, does this offer provide good work, with
                good
                people, in a good environment for you? Answer those questions for yourself.</p>
            <p><strong>Hot Skills And Industries</strong></p>
            <p>Right now, says Clements-Skelton, one of the most in-demand or beneficial skills a job applicant can have
                is some
                level of coding or understanding of software language. “There’s virtually no limit to what somebody who
                can do
                some basic programming can do in the workplace,” she said. “Because it’s not just for engineering
                anymore. It
                has invaded marketing and finance and HR—we’re all working on databases. We’ve turned into a workforce
                dependent
                upon databases, so having any kind of technical savvy there is going to enhance your career.”</p>
            <p>Engineering, as an industry, is hot, says Clements-Skelton. Mechanical engineering, as a job, is in high
                demand.
                The technical demands of many engineering jobs are starting to blur the lines between white and blue
                collar
                workers.</p>
            <p>Another space to watch is healthcare, especially as it pertains to the Baby Boomer generation,
                “Everything from
                home healthcare to skilled planning to housing,” and even financial planning for retirees or those whose
                careers
                have slowed.</p>
            <p><strong>The Future Of Job Hunting</strong></p>
            <p>Job seekers have never been as empowered as they are now, given the ease of research and the easy access
                to
                professional networks. This is leading, says Clements-Skelton, to a reality in which they can, with a
                few simple
                clicks, apply for numerous jobs within a small timeframe. Since it’s so simple to apply for work, it’s
                harder to
                ascertain from simple applications who wants the job more. “Going back eight or nine years, there was a
                natural
                hindrance to applying—you had to really want it,” she explained. “You had to know what you were talking
                about,
                you had to understand the job, you had to write the cover letter—there was an intentionality about
                applying that
                we’ve lost.”</p>
            <p>That makes life harder for recruiters, who are forced to deal with a higher volume of applicants that
                can, with
                the tough of a button, hurl reams of resume and qualification data at them. That will change the way
                they post
                jobs in the future. “We’re going to find our job descriptions and postings becoming increasingly narrow
                because
                it’s the only way to try and reduce the applicant pool.” That, says Clements-Skelton, could cause the
                individual
                in the workforce to have fewer competencies and be more specialized, i.e. less able to be fluid and
                adaptable to
                multiple tasks.</p>
